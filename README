nfOSC - http://github.com/mkalten/nfosc/
A simple utility that sends RFID tag add & remove events via TUIO/OSC.
(c) 2009-14 Martin Kaltenbrunner http://modin.yuri.at/

This tool is based on the libnfc library, which allows to access one or multiple USB RFID reader devices. When  an RFID tag is  placed onto the device, 
the application sends a simple /nfosc/add message to the provided UDP port. An equivalent /nfosc/del message is sent when the tag is removed. 
Additionally this application also sends TUIO2 symbol messages within the same OSC bundle that encode the RFID tag states. 

This package includes a command line utility for Linux and MacOS X, as well as a simple GUI application for MacOS X. The source code distribution also includes make files for both platforms as well as an Xcode project for the Mac GUI.

OSC message syntax:
/nfosc/[event] int32 int32 int32 string

OSC message semantics:
/nfosc/add session_id symbol_id reader_id tag_type tag_uid
/nfosc/del session_id symbol_id reader_id tag_type tag_uid

default OSC/UDP address and port: 127.0.0.1 3333

TUIO2: This application also sends TUIO2 compliant symbol messages within the same OSC bundle. Please see http://www.tuio.org/?tuio20 for further 
information on the latest revision of the TUIO protocol. 

symbol database:
the symbol_id - tag_uid relation is stored in the file nfosc.db
new tag_uids are assigned dynamically and stored for later use

this source package should compile on Linux and MacOS X
you will need the following libraries to compile this application:
liblo 0.28	http://liblo.sourceforge.net/
libnfc 1.7.1	http://www.libnfc.org/

to compile and install just type:
./configure
make
make install
