(c) 2009-2014 Martin Kaltenbrunner http://modin.yuri.at/

you can download the necessary nfOSC tool from: http://github/mkalten/nfosc/

this simple example shows how to decode the nfosc message structure based on the temporary tag ID.
there are three sample loops configured, which are triggered and stopped by the according RFID tags.

the three included sound samples by Bitbeast have been retrieved from freesound.org
this patch is using the oscx OSC external for Pure Data, which is included for Mac and PC
